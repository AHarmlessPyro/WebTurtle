Commands : 
1.	Move N units : **forward X**, X can be negative
2.	Rotate in XZ : **rotate X Angle**. Defaults to right turns. Can be turned left if X is replaced with -X or angle is negative.
3.  Rotate in XY : **rotate Y Angle**. Defaults to right turns. Can be turned left if Y is replaced with -Y or angle is negative.
// Note Rotation along YZ is not supported as it would be functionally similar to other two since there is symmetry along one axis.
4.	Lift pen: **up**
5.  Put down pen: **down**
4.	Repeat Sequence : **repeat (Count) , [Sequence,]** . Repeat a series of actions for n counts. Actions are separated by a comma (,). 
5.	Curve(Angle, Radius) : This can be accomplished using a suitable Repeat Command. So, repeat 32, forward 3, rotate X 11.25 would create a circle (not made of smooth splines arguably, but still)
6.	Recurse (Start) (Intervals), [Sequence,] : Recurse on a sequence. Regrettably, this is a hack at best and isnâ€™t perfect. While it works, results are not as intended and there is still work required to draw figures like trees/leaves.


## Note on running on local machine : 

If running on local machine, some sort of server is required. I did this using IIS on windows, but suitable easy alternatives could be in 
```python
python3 -m http.server
```
(See [this Mozilla page for more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)).

This is due to CORS requirements where pages (local or otherwise) can't access local files that aren't in their own directory (at least without flipping a few flags). When running a server, root should always be where the index file is or a folder containing the index.html file, otherwise CORS and loading issues will persist.
